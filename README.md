# ****Health Assist****

 
Health Assist is a comprehensive medical website designed to revolutionize healthcare processes and elevate patient care. It offers a range of features aimed at improving diagnosis accuracy, facilitating seamless communication between patients and healthcare providers, and optimizing hospital management.


## **Introduction**

Health Assist is a project developed during the HackOverFlow 2.0 hackathon. It combines advanced technologies such as image processing and machine learning to provide predictive diagnosis capabilities, along with a hospital management system to streamline administrative tasks.

## **Features**

Disease Prediction using Image Processing: Utilizes MRI scans, X-rays, and microscopy images to predict diseases accurately.
Disease Prediction using Patient's Symptoms: Predicts diseases based on the symptoms provided by the patient.
Hospital Management System: Provides a comprehensive system with separate interfaces for administrators, patients, and doctors, facilitating efficient management of hospital operations.

## **Modules**
There are 3 Branches/Module parts of our Project:

**1.HealthAssist**

Predicts diseases using both image processing and symptom analysis.

**2.VideoMeet**

Allows seamless video conferencing for remote consultations.

**3.Disease_Detection**

Focuses on disease prediction using various inputs.




It is a medical website offering various features to streamline healthcare processes and enhance patient care. It is mainely divided into 4 parts:

### **1.Disease Prediction using Image preocessing (here MRI scans, X-rays,microscopy images are used)**
